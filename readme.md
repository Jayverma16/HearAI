🧠 HearAI — Local AI Inference Backend

HearAI is a general-purpose local inference backend designed to run speech, LLM, and AI models entirely on your own machine.
It powers local AI applications such as:

• Speech-to-Text
• Meeting summarization
• Voice assistants
• Private LLM chatbots
• Action & intent extraction

No cloud. No data leaks. 100% local.
